# Forum-Hub
Forum-Hub is a lightweight, full-stack web application built to simulate a basic online discussion forum. Users can register, log in, post topics, and engage in threaded conversations. The project is ideal for learning how web apps function, especially the integration between front-end UI and back-end database operations.
